ibus-pinyin (1.5.0-5) unstable; urgency=medium

    Package ibus-pinyin is now deprecated; its upstream has stopped development
    for years in favour of new ibus-libpinyin. New ibus users should install
    ibus-libpinyin instead of this package. This package (ibus-pinyin) will be
    removed after Debian Buster (Debian 10) release.
